In order to facilitate the access to the contents of the [Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI)](https://dtcenter.org/community-code/gridpoint-statistical-interpolation-gsi) diagnostic files, it has been written the [readDiag](https://github.com/GAD-DIMNT-CPTEC/readDiag) package wich is Fortran/Python interface that aims to read the GSI diagnostic binary files and create appropriate data structures to it. 

The figure below was created with the use of the readDiag package and shows the spatial distribution of the wind observations of different kinds from different sources. All information is provided by the GSI diagnostic files.
